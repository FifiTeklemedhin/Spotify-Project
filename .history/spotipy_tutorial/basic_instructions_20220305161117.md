## Venv
### First Steps
* seeing if you have installed it: virtualenv venv
* installing it: ```python3 -m pip3 install --user virtualenv```
* activating: ```source venv/bin/activate```
* deactivating: ```deactivate```

### ENV Variables
* so far have client ID, secret, and redirect URI

## Spotify Info
* uses [scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/), make users know that third party apps only access info they choose to be shared

## Killing a port
* find process by doing ```sudo lsof -i:portNumber```
* ```kill PID``` (you find PID from last command)
* check to see if port closed (nothing returns in that case)

## Ignoring a file
* ```touch .gitignore``` in main repo
* add the file name to the **.gitignore** file
* use this documentation to figure it out
  
### If you accidentally commit a file and want to remove it from staging area
* ```git rm --cached <file>```
* commit changes again
