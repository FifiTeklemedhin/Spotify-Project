# Issues
## Styles
- `styles.css` won't style body tag, assigned it a class in `layout.html` to get around it
- `styles.css` `spotify-bookitalic` does not work
- `styles.css` can't increase `h` tag's font size
- `styles.css` `a:link` only modifies one track's link, manually assigned `a` tags in `index.html` a class called `track-link`, which works when I style

## History page
- printing grids for short, medium, and long term tracks is v repetitive code: unsure on how to make a function for them
