# Issues
* ask if alright to define a login_required flag using this code exactly: https://pythonprogramming.net/decorator-wrappers-flask-tutorial-login-required/
## Styles
- `styles.css` won't style body tag, assigned it a class in `layout.html` to get around it
- `styles.css` `spotify-bookitalic` does not work
- `styles.css` can't increase `h` tag's font size
- `styles.css` `a:link` only modifies one track's link, manually assigned `a` tags in `index.html` a class called `track-link`, which works when I style

## History page
- printing grids for short, medium, and long term tracks is v repetitive code: unsure on how to make a function for them

## Reccomendations page
- links not working for albums; I think I have correct ones they just won't work through the API, even if I click on them manually on json

## analysis:
- using randint to get some random associated artists, not entirely random though
